# WebChatApp

Hello, and welcome to our chat app!

This is a chat messaging app which you can use to communicate with your friends. The app was built as part of "Advanced Programming 2" course in Bar-Ilan Univesity.

This repository contains the server's side of the chat. In order to run the client side you should look for the repository named "React-Chat".

If you wish to run the server, all you need to do is to open the solution of the WebChat in Visual Studion and click on the 'play' button, which named "WebChatApAP1".

Now the swagger will open up and you can 'play' with the server with 'GET', 'POST', 'EDIT, 'DELETE' commands.

Wish you enjoy your time!
